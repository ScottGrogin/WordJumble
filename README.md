# WordJumble
A word jumble console app in c++

To create more jumbles you will need to add new text files to the WordFiles folder.

This file goes over how to format your text files to add more words into the word jumbler.
Each line should contain a word to be jumbled, a colon : , and a hint to help the player with solving.
There should not be spaces at the beginning or end of the word, and there should be no space between 
the colon and the first letter in the hint. Also there should be no blank lines betwene each word and hint 
pair.

Below is a good example. The word internet would be at the top of the text file.
```
